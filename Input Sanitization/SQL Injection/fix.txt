SQL Injection is a server-side exploit which can be leveraged to read, modify and delete database contents.

Some scenarios where SQL Injection may occur would be :
    - Logging in to a website
    - Signing up for a website
    - Searching for a product using an SQL query

Some ways to prevent SQL Injection would be to :
    - Used prepared queries
    - Wrap user supplied variables in quotes. Example:
            SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = '1';
         Instead Of:
             SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1;
    
     - Remove quotes from the user supplied input
